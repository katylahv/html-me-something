            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p>As an orphaned puppy destined for euthanization,
            the little angel otherwise known as Frenchie was adopted 
            in Columbia, Missouri on September 11th 2011. 
            As a puppy, Frenchie loved to bother the older dogs she lived with, eat her mom's socks, 
            and climb to the top of staircases only to whine until mom came to rescue her because she couldn't quite
            figure out how to get back down.

             <h3>Breed</h3>
            <p>
            Although Frenchie's exact breed is unknown<
            because her owner is too cheap to get a DNA test, 
            it is agreed upon by at least two vets that 
            she's probably just a deer-head Chihuahua.
