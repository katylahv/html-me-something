            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p>As an orphaned puppy destined for euthanization, </br>
            the little angel otherwise known as Frenchie was adopted </br>
            in Columbia, Missouri on September 11th 2011. </br>
            As a puppy, Frenchie loved to bother the older dogs she lived with, eat her mom's socks, </br>
            and climb to the top of staircases only to whine until mom came to rescue her because she couldn't quite</br>
            figure out how to get back down. </br>

             <h3>Breed</h3>
            <p>
            Although Frenchie's exact breed is unknown because her owner is too cheap to get a DNA test, </br>
            it is agreed upon by at least two vets that she's probably just a deer-head Chihuahua.</br>
